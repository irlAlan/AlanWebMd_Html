# AlanWeb
The start of my personal website and maybe blog

Generating html files from markdown then shoving it into a template with basic css.
Might change this idea later on depending on how pretty I want the website to be or if I have different plans entierly.

# Getting Started

1. create a build directory
```
mkdir build
```
2. run cmake
```
cmake -B build/
cmake --build build/
```
3. run the executable
```
./AlanWeb
```
